# quickcheck

Property-based, type-based testing for Nim.

```nim
import unittest, quickcheck, algorithm

test "some invariants of the `reversed` function":
  check satisfy do (xs: string) -> bool:
    xs.reversed.reversed == xs

  check satisfy do (xs, ys: string) -> bool:
    (xs & ys).reversed == ys.reversed & xs.reversed
```

```
  +++ OK, passed 100 quick checks.
  +++ OK, passed 100 quick checks.
[OK] some invariants of the `reversed` function
```

It works with [`unittest`](https://nim-lang.org/docs/unittest.html), as a
standalone library (and probably with `testament`) and is inspired by
[QuickCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck) and
[SmallCheck](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/smallcheck) (see below).
